Super Cool Nice Antivirus 2025 version 1.02!1!1!!! (Or SCNAV. Pronounced SCUH-NAV)
Runs on Windows 7 and up. 
Prefered that you run on Windows 7, Because i tested and compiled it on there

Here is the main GUI!
I edited it with Autorun Pro Enterprise (An old program from 2008) http://www.longtion.com/autorunenterprise/autorunpro.htm

This is the source code of my shitty. but very strong antivirus. Currently the database im using is 1.1gb and has over 32 million virus hashs. 
The scan / remove part of it runs on python. Version 3.8 for Windows 7 compatibility!!!!!  

There is a website i am hosting for this at 
You can go and download a compiled DVD ISO Installer over there! Get it fast because the server is only up for every now and then 

I will add full source code here soon! just really lazy rn... sorry!
